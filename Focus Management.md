### Question 2:

Paraphrase all the ideas in the above videos and this one in detail.

### Answer 2:

In the video, titled: "Optimal duration for deep work is at least 1 hour". The key ideas discussed are as follows:

- the speaker and listener discuss the minimum time duration to engage in deep work and get into that 'flow state'.
- Switching context between an ongoing task breaks the flow state of deep work and one should avoid switching to tasks out of the context of the ongoing task.
- The speaker then recommends one hour as the minimum time duration to get engaged in deep work.
- They also stress the importance of taking breaks in between to recharge oneself and maintain focus.

In the video, titled: "Are deadlines good for productivity?". The key ideas discussed are as follows:

- the way our mind works is that it tries to avoid things it finds hard or things that require much effort, without deadlines it generally keeps postponing the task at hand.
- to get work done, deadlines work amazingly, once a deadline is fixed, there is no option for the mind to avoid the hard thing but to make deadlines work there has to be some overseeing authority that takes progress updates, to ensure deadlines are met.
- fixing a deadline puts an end to the mind debate that maybe this can be done sometime later. having deadlines for tasks, also makes a person more goal-oriented and he can get more things done in less time.

What are your key takeaways from the above video?

### Answer 4:

Key takeaways from the video:

- social media can harm mental health and is very addictive. Its harmful impact can be explained by the constant need for validation it creates when a user starts to keep a tally of likes and followers.
- one of the reasons why a person starts using social media is "FOMO", which is the fear of missing out, and also it is made addictive by design to increase the number of hours people stay on it.
- social media can permanently reduce our capacity to put in deep effort and sustain concentration.
- In today's time to survive in the increasingly competitive economy, the skill of putting in the deep effort is crucial and by using social media we are in a way putting ourselves at risk of being irrelevant to the current economy.
- Social media can a platform for putting in our creative work and ideas in front of the whole world, but it must be done consciously. The control must always remain with us rather than social media controlling us.
