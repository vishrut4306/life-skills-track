## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique

### Q1 What is the Feynman Technique? Paraphrase the video in your own words.

Someone who has clearly understood a certain topic then he will be able to explain the topic with utmost ease and in simpler terms. There’s a quote that goes around which says _"if you can’t explain it simply then you don’t understand it well enough"_ meaning that if someone is not able to explain a concept/topic in plain simple language then it might be the case that the person himself has not understood the topic very clearly.

To understand a topic clearly we can take the help of a technique called the Feynman technique. This technique has been developed by world-renowned physicist Richard P. Feynman, a Nobel prize winner, nicknamed “the great explainer” pointing at his ability to explain deep concepts in a very simple language. There’s a lot we can learn from Feynman's technique and implement it in our daily lives.

Why we need the Feynman technique:
Feynman was a physicist and used this technique himself while working on equations and models. To use this technique one need not be a physicist and can be used by someone working in other domains such as web development or history. This technique can be used to get a clear understanding of any concept that is shaky.

Feynman Technique:
“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool “

- take a piece of paper and write the name of the concept
- explain the concept like you are doing it to a layman, and explain with examples.
- now recognize where you are getting stuck in explaining and things are getting shaky.
- now take a self-review of the explanation and see where you are complicating things and work around to simplify the explanation.
- The key here is to simplify things to the lowest level which makes the topic crystal clear, even to a layman or kid.

### Q2 What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?

- While working on learning new technologies, we often come across concepts that are new to us and we see them for the first time, it generally takes some time to get comfortable with those concepts. In such scenarios, one can make the best use of the Feynman technique and work on the concept by explaining it again and again in the mind, unless it can be explained in simple language.
- Also sometimes we have understood a concept, but if someone asks to explain, in the middle of an explanation the voice gets shaky and one might fumble. This shows our inability to explain, this can be done away by approaching this with the Feynman technique and solving this by repeated cycles of explanations in the mind till one can explain it without stopping in between.
- A means to check If, one has really understood a problem is to see if that concept can be explained to someone with no base knowledge about that thing or to a layman. If one is successful in explaining it to a kid or layman means that he himself has a clear understanding of the topic.

## Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley

### Q3 Paraphrase the video titled "Learning how to learn | Barbara Oakley" in detail in your own words.

The brain can be compared to a pinball machine having focus mode and diffused mode. When problem-solving: you are solving a problem with complete attention and focus but are stuck at some point for a longer period of time, one can try to switch states and try to leave that problem for some while so that the diffused state works in and in that moment of creativity which happens in the background and not in the conscious mind, a new idea pops up which can give a new direction to the solution of the problem and act as a breakthrough.

Salvador Dali, a brilliant painter 20th century used to sit back in a chair and relax while holding keys, the moment he would get sleepy, the keys would drop off his hands and this would wake him up and then he would go from the diffused state to focus mode and start working on his painting problem with fresh new ideas. Thomas Edison, according to a legend also used the same transition whenever he was stuck he would take a break and sit back and relax with ball bearings in his hands and the moment he would get into sleep the ball bearings would fall waking him up, and then he would take his ideas from diffused mode to focus mode and work on his inventions.

What happens in the brain during procrastination is that, whenever one encounters an unpleasant task pain is experienced in some part of the brain. Two ways to deal with this: one is to keep walking away, another is to switch to a pleasant task but this can cause problems in long term. The Pomodoro technique says to work with focussed attention for 25 minutes and then play or relax or listen to music. One trait of a creative person is that it takes time for a creative person to learn new things because a creative person’s mind tries to think in all direction and new idea creeps in from everywhere. A slower think might take more time but his experience in reaching the conclusion is much more profound than others.

Understanding a topic is not sufficient to gain mastery of that topic, understanding alongside practice and repetition in a variety of circumstances brings in the mastery of the topic. Learning how to learn is the most powerful tool you can grasp. Don’t just follow your passions, broaden your passions and life will be beautiful.

### Q4 What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?

- One thing I can work on while understanding a big or lengthy topic is that after reading the topic, I can try to recall without looking at the source of information and check how much I can recall and then gain a look if I forget something somewhere. Research says this builds neuropathways.

- I can also make use of the Pomodoro technique whereby devoting a hundred percent of my attention to a given task at a time for 25 minutes and then relax and then repeat this cycle.

- Another technique that I can incorporate is focus mode and diffused mode and learn how to transition between the two whenever found myself stuck in some problem.

- One other thing that I have been doing wrong until this point was as soon as I understood a new topic I used to put it away after learning it. Learning new things is similar to listening to new songs, only after listening to a new song multiple times, the lyrics get locked in the memory and the same has to be done with learning new concepts, after understanding it once, keep resisting it every now and then, basically understanding with repetition and practice.

## 3. Learn Anything in 20 hours

### Q5 Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.

Research says it takes 10,000 hours
to learn a new thing, to get to an expert level in any given field such as athletics, sports, chess, and music. However, the statement is not true if we say it takes 10,000 hours to learn something new, If this is not true wait till the end of this article to know. If we evaluate the learning curve for any given task, we will find that how good we are at a certain thing increases exponentially with increasing practice time and at a certain point it becomes constant.

It takes 20 hours to learn a new skill such as learning how to draw, learning a language, or learning to juggle. 45 minutes a day for a month amounts to 20 hours and it can be done to learn any new skill with deliberate practice to get shocking results.
There are steps it can be done intelligently.

- Deconstruct the skill: a skill itself is generally a grouping of other small skills, so breaking down a skill into smaller parts and then identifying the most important parts, and then working on those parts.
- Learn enough to self-correct: get some courses, or books to learn the skill which can be referred to.
- Remove distractions: such as tv, social media
- Practice at least 20 hours

The major barrier to learning any new skill is not intellectual, it is emotional, and we feel stupid. Put 20 hours into anything you want to learn and that’s it.

### Q6 What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?

Steps I will take while approaching a new topic:

- Keep revisiting concepts/ topics every now and then, this will help in setting the concept in mind. Just like with listening to songs, if you listen to a song on repeat lyrics get locked in memory.
- Try to get into a Deep work/flow state wherein I have my undivided attention devoted to a piece of work so that my cognitive abilities work at their limits.
- Learn to transition effectively between focus mode and transition mode whenever feeling stuck, this will enormously help in building a problem-solving attitude and heighten my problem-solving skills.
- After understanding a certain topic then putting in sincere practice and repetition in that practice rather than putting away that concept after understanding.
