## 2. Reflective Listening

### Q2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening ?

### A2. Reflective listening is used as a concept by therapists in psychotherapy, but we are only going to discuss it as far as it is significant at the organizational level. There are 2 major ways of client-centered listening:

1. Listening Orientation -

- In this, the listener mainly adopts the ‘therapists hypothesis ‘ which mainly discusses that the power of problem-solving, self-insight, and growth all reside within the speaker itself, therefore the listener should not think “what can he do for the speaker” but rather “how to make the speaker see their situations”.
- Listening Orientation contains four components: empathy, acceptance, congruence, and concreteness.
  Empathy is a desire to understand another person’s situation from his point of view rather than some external point of view. usage of phrases such as “I follow you”, and “I’m with you” denote non-judgemental understanding.
- Acceptance and empathy are closely related, acceptance is having dignity for another human being.
- congruence - is the quality to stay open and not hide anything or be genuine on the part of the listener.
- Congruence can sometimes be in conflict with acceptance and empathy; for example, if a listener is annoyed with the speaker, there’s no way the speaker can be genuine and hide his feelings of annoyance to make way for empathy.
- Concreteness - means being specific and not listening to vague generalities. The listener often tends to talk in general to hide away their pain.

2. Technique of Reflection.

- When the listener cross-checks with the speaker about the listener’s understanding of the speaker’s situation and seeks clarity and see if both are on the same page, this is known as reflection.
- It has many advantages such as it adds to the listener’s understanding and It can assist in thought clarification.

3. Principles of Reflective Thinking:

- Less talking, more listening
- Listening to personal topics
- Restating the speaker’s words to be on the same page
- Interacting with empathy and acceptance

### Q4. What can you do to improve your listening?

### Steps to improve listening :

- Start to think of the speaker’s situation from their point of view and not think from my own frame of reference
- Be more empathetic and respectful towards other human beings which will generate the required acceptance towards any speaker and present me as a more reflective listener.
- Try to be less talkative and more involved in other person’s speaking
- Cross-checking my own understanding of the speaker’s situation and therefore increasing my own understanding and thought clarification.
