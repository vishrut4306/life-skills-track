### Question 1:

[Forget big change, start with a tiny habit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8)

Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

### Answer 1:

- Anything life-changing, whatever goal it is that you have in mind can be approached by developing tiny habits.
- "Rome was not built in a day" and anything substantial that we might want to achieve cannot be done overnight. In other words, start by making small steps.
- The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, similarly tiny habits are easy to form and if followed regularly they can help achieve big tasks.
- Any habit is a result of motivation, trigger, and behavior. motivation is the reward behind the action performed, and the trigger is what makes you do the action.
- The essence of the whole video is that, start small. by starting small we can break down a complex task into smaller parts. take the example of doing 50 push-ups a day, this can be approached by doing 5 push-ups initially and a trigger can also be set for this that do 5 push-ups after every hour.
- The last step is to celebrate every time a new tiny habit is formed, this will act as a motivation.

### Question 2:

Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible

### Answer 2:

- Three reasons lead to the formation of a habit. These are motivation, the ability to do it, and lastly the trigger.
- Relying on motivation every time to do tasks is a foolish strategy. This is because it is hard to find motivation every time for something, instead, we should reduce the hardness of the task at hand, by breaking the task into small parts or reducing its intensity.
- Step 1 in the process is to find the tiniest version of the habit you want to develop in your daily routine. For example, the tiniest version of 1-hour meditation is being mindful of a single breath.
- Similarly, while setting the goal of running a marathon, start by going for walk for 5 minutes every day.
- Step 2, create a trigger that will remind you to start with the tiny habit. This trigger can be another event of action completion, which will harness the momentum from the previous action to perform the next action.
- Step 3, start celebrating after the completion of a tiny habit, this will act like a reward system and will go long way in forming sustainable habits.

### Question 3

How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?

### Answer 3

B = MAP is a formula that stands for Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. This formula is useful in the process of creating new habits as follows:

- Motivation: Let's say I want to develop the habit of going gym. So the motivating force behind my going to the gym can be the health reasons and the feel-good factor of a fit body.

- Ability: I find, exercise challenging and enjoy the process of overcoming obstacles or hurdles. So, I would begin by setting small goals and gradually increasing my standards.

- Prompt: anything that triggers the behavior. A phone call from a friend who also goes to the gym can also act as a trigger.

### Question 4

Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

### Answer 4:

- Celebrating and shining after completing a habit acts as a reward system for the brain and can boost motivation and help to create a sense of accomplishment. Celebrating after completing a habit shoots up self-esteem and self-confidence.

- I have personally, observed the effect of celebration after completing tasks at hand, it immediately brings in a positive mindset, and this memory of celebration acts as a stimulus for the activity to be performed next time.

### Question 5:

Your takeaways from the video (Minimum 5 points)

### Answer 5:

- We often tend to neglect the enriching effect of small improvements and fail to visualize how small improvements add up over time and lead to significant growth.
- On the path to progress, consistency is very important. By being consistent we can focus on small changes every day which will lead to sustainable long-term success.
- Developing a long-term habit, demands to visualize the bigger picture. focus less on short-term goals and outcomes and instead focus on the overall process.
- The amount of success we get in our life is directly proportional to the number of good habits we develop in our life.
- Failure is an inevitable part of the process and is bound to come, so accept the failure as an opportunity to improve.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

[Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results - Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT7tQzmGRLA)

### Question 6:

Write about the book's perspective on habit formation from the lens of Identity, processes, and outcomes.

### Answer 6:

- Identity: the perspective discussed in the book is that to achieve a certain benchmark in life, we need to develop all the qualities and take actions that someone who's already achieved those benchmarks does.
- Processes: try to make the process as lucrative, attractive, and enjoyable as possible, by doing this you make it satisfying for the mind to indulge in it. this reinforces good habits over time.
- Outcomes: the goals are as necessary as identity and process, as outcomes are the motivating force and make the behavior change possible.

### Question 7

Write about the book's perspective on how to make a good habit easier.

### Answer 7:

- Make a good habit easier is to reduce friction, like if I want to play guitar it is advisable to put the guitar outside of the bag and on the table, the sight of the guitar will act as a trigger.
- Sometimes you have the motivation but no clarity, and this slows down progress. always create a clear plan which is easier to follow through. For example, if you want to learn guitar, you must have done the research and should have a laid-out plan on how to proceed with things at the basic level.
- Another thing that can be done to make the process easier is to start small and gradually increase the hardness level and then continue with it over time.

### Question 8

Write about the book's perspective on making a bad habit more difficult.

### Answer 8

- The hack to make the bad habit more difficult is to make them less appealing as generally bad habits are easy and require less effort.
- To make a bad habit more difficult is to add friction, increase the effort required or change the environment.
- Suppose you want to get away with the habit of using lat night social media, just put the phone in a different room these days come phones come with zen mode and in that time duration, most of the phone functions are disallowed.

## 5. Reflection:

### Question 9:

Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

### Answer 9:

I would like to start eating healthy food:

- I can do this to set passing by the market on my way back home as a trigger to stop and drink coconut water, which is a great anti-oxidant.
- I can include fruits in my diet, like drinking fruit juice one hour after having lunch.

### Question 10:

Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

### Answer 10:

I would like to give up on my habit of eating junk food:

- Whenever I am feeling hungry, I could opt for more healthy food options.
- While passing by the food market, on my way back home if I have the urge to eat junk food, one thing I can do is to remind myself of the harms of it and mold myself into the identity of a healthy person.
- Lastly, the way our mind works is that whenever it feels low, it tries to get an immediate sense of satisfaction by indulging in a pleasure state, thereby eating junk food, which is good in taste but bad for health. So dealing with low or negative emotions will fix the problem at its origin.
