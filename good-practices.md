# Good Practices for Software Development

## Review Questions:

### Question 1:

What is your one major takeaway from each one of the 6 sections? So 6 points in total.

### Answer 1:

- making notes is essential, as it can be viewed later as a reference, and try to clear doubts in the meeting itself, as it is maybe difficult to get everyone online again.
- if for any reason, I will be unavailable during work hours then it is my responsibility to convey the situation to relevant team members.
- asking a question is not enough to get the answer, asking it in the correct way is also important. In the correct way meaning it should cover the details of what has been tried already and explain the problem with the help of diagrams, and screenshots.
- getting to know your company, and teammates is a very essential aspect of work as well.
- it is always a good idea to send one compiled message containing all doubts rather then bombard multiple messages.
- whatever activity is being done, it should be done with full involvement. at work time, only work-related notifications should be turned on the phone and other disturbances such as social media should not interrupt workflow.

### Question 2:

Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

### Answer 2:

I think I can improve upon the communication side of things more like:

- always in a meeting, try to keep note of things so that it is clear to me what the other person has in mind and then maybe confirm with the speaker later. This will ensure there is no communication gap.
- inform unavailability in case of unavoidable circumstances, such as no internet, and no electricity. I can keep the relevant team members informed of such circumstances.
- ask questions in such a fashion that the other person has not put in much effort to understand the question, and the effort saved is thus put into answering the question. The person at the other end may be reluctant in answering if it is hard for him to understand.
