### Question 1:

Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few lines. Use your own words.

### Answer 1:

The speaker in the start of video comes to the point that success in acquiring a skill is not a matter of talent only but also dependent on the motivation behind. She tries to explore the question that what is it that makes one successful in life and school. She studied children and adults both in various institutions and then concluded that grit is determining factor in being successful. It is not social intelligence, good looks, physical health, or intelligence quotient which makes one successful.

Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is living life like it's a marathon and not a sprint. It is the practice of being consistent while keeping in line with future goals. The speaker then dwells on the question of how one becomes gritty. One becomes gritty by having a growth mindset and learning to accept failures as a part of the process.

## 2. Introduction to Growth Mindset

### Question 3:

Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few lines in your own words.

### Answer 3:

In the world of sports and education. There’s a new concept revolving around called growth mindset. The growth mindset is significantly improving the way people learn. The idea of the growth mindset is discovered by Stanford Professor, Carol Dweck. Carol says that what differentiates two equally capable people in success is their mindset. Different kinds of mindsets in learning :

**Fixed mindset:**
this idea suggests that skills are born and can’t be developed.
This kind of mindset has little room for growth. Listed below are the characteristics of fixed mindset:

- Back down/ Give up
- Get discouraged
- Shy away from feedback

**Growth Mindset:** this idea suggests that skills are developed and one can be in control of their abilities by building upon them. This created ample growth opportunities. Listed below are characteristics of growth mindset:

- Belief in oneself
- Embrace and persevere
- Use feedback to learn

### Question 4:

What are your key takeaways from the video to take action on?

### Answer 4:

My key takeaways are:

- By understanding the characteristics of both mindsets namely growth and fixed, I think I am more aligned with the growth mindset and in parts of life where I show a fixed mindset, I would be more than willing to adopt a growth mindset.
- A growth mindset begins with a belief in one’s ability to develop new skills through continuous hard work.
- I would take feedback from my seniors and mentors as a challenge to get better. Feedback from others is an opportunity to rectify mistakes and be better than before.

## 3. Understanding Internal Locus of Control

### Question 5:

What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?

### Answer 5:

Thinking you are talented makes you lazy. People who think they are talented, and that is the reason they perform well, tend to be lazy because irrespective of whether they work, they will perform well because talent is something that you’re born with and are not in control of. Locus of control is the degree to which one believes he/she has control over their life.

So the people who think they are talented or gifted have an external locus of control, meaning that their performance is dependent on external factors such as being born talented. While people who think that they performed well based on their hard work, make them believe in an internal locus of control, that is that the power to change thing reside within them and that if they are determined to work hard on something, things will change for the better.

**Key Points:**

- I will believe that I have control over my life, it is my extra effort that will change the result.
- I will not state not being born with gifts/talents is an excuse for my underperformance if any. Rather put in the extra hours, which is entirely in my control and therefore creates an internal locus of control.
- If any time in life, I feel a lack of motivation, I would believe in the internal focus of control that I possess and seek results by putting in an effort.

## 4. How to build a Growth Mindset

### Question 6:

### Answer 6:

Thinking that “we are who we are and things are how they are and they will be the way they are” is the worst thing that someone can think of themselves. This creates a fixed mindset disallowing any room for growth.

**Rules for growth mindset:**

- Believe in oneself and the ability to figure things out.
  Discard wrong assumptions about yourself, that limits you to your past self and narrow down any scope for a better future self.
- Develop your curriculum: gather all the resources about the skills that you want to develop and start designing your curriculum.
- Honor the struggle: accept failures as part of the learning process. Difficulties forge stronger character and therefore value your struggles and hard times.

- Get adapted to highs and lows, good times and hardships, and honor the struggle as part of a long-term growth mindset that eventually leads to growth as an individual.

### Question 7:

What are your key takeaways from the video to take action on?

### Answer 7:

My key takeaways are:

- The first step to achieving any dream is to begin thinking that it is possible and within one’s reach. This helps in taking the first step and from thereon it is only a matter of time and grit.

- Be the architect of the life that you want. This starts with me designing my way to my dream and the skills that I want to learn by gathering resources. The world is changing every second, and as a software engineer, I am in a more difficult position if I refuse to change with time. To make a great career in software engineering, I will have to be susceptible to change and be ready to adapt to any new and challenging situation.

- When in difficult times, keep going, honor struggle because when I get knocked down, it is a new challenge to deal with, and with this ‘calm amidst the chaos’ attitude I can figure out anything.

## 5. Mindset - A MountBlue Warrior Reference Manual

### Question 8:

What are one or more points that you want to take action on from the manual?

### Answer 8:

Points that i want to take action on are listed below:

- I will not leave my code unfinished till I complete the following checklist:
  - make it work
  - Make it readable
  - Make it modular
  - Make it efficient

**My resolution on this point:**
There was a time when I only used to be concerned with making a piece of code work, now I will be focusing on making it readable, modular, and efficient alongside making it work. A code that is not readable is as good as ‘no code’ written because then it can’t be made used by anyone else than its author.

<br>

- I will understand the users very well. I will serve them and society by writing rock-solid excellent software.

**My resolution on this point:**
As a software engineer, I understand that my end goal is to solve user problems and create a smooth experience for users. As a software engineer, I can earn a respectable living but at the same time, I can achieve a higher purpose by solving the problems of society by writing lines of code. I intend to do this with my full dedication.

<br>

- I will be focused on mastery till I can do things half asleep. If someone wakes me up at 3 AM in the night, I will calmly solve the problem like James Bond and go to sleep.

**My resolution on this point:**
I try to make sure that whatever work I do I do it at the highest level possible. One way to ensure this is by gaining mastery of whatever field that I work in, James Bond is a good example of efficiency and “calm amidst the chaos”. I try to incorporate his attitude into my life .
