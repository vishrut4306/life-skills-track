##  4. Sleep is your superpower

### Question 4:

Paraphrase the Sleep is your Superpower video in detail.

The Speaker begins with the statement that a lack of sleep can age a man by 10 years. Without sleep our brain is unable to soak in the information passed, it needs sleep so that it can save the information in the memory and sleep is also essential to remember new information. Hippocampus is part of the brain responsible for receiving new information and then holding onto them. Research carried out by the speaker points out that people who had a good one night's sleep showed signals of good brain activity while sleep-deprived participants in the research showed no healthy brain activity and were unable to save in any new knowledge that was being passed to them.

**Concept of aging and dementia:** The speaker finds out that the main cause behind dementia, poor memory, and Alzheimer's disease is poor sleep. This is an alarming observation and helps us in understanding the very importance of a good sleep routine. Four hours of sleep can bring in as much as a 70 % drop in natural killer cell activity. Natural killer cells are responsible for immune deficiency and therefore drop in natural killer cell counts is a drop in immune deficiency. The speaker overall explains that sleep deprivation can lead to serious health problems such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even cancer of various forms. Lack of sleep can also affect our cognitive abilities, emotional regulation, and overall quality of life.

The quality of sleep can be made better by regularising sleep patterns and avoiding alcohol and caffeine as they have negative effects on sleep patterns.
