# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### Question 1:

What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

### Answer 1:

There are three kinds of behavior that can cause sexual harassment :
* Verbal Harassment
  * making comments about other person's bodies, their clothing.
  * cracking gender/sexual jokes.
  * asking someone out on a date multiple times even after being rejected several times.
  * requesting sexual favors or sexual innuendos.
  * spreading rumors about someone's personal or sexual life.
  * using foul or obscene language.

* Visual Harassment
    * obscene drawings or posters on a wall in the workplace environment.
    * obscene screensavers, cartoons, or emails at the workplace.
* Physical Harassment
    * being aggressive to another individual in a sexual manner.
    * blocking movement.
    * inappropriate physical contact such as kissing, rubbing, hugging, padding, and stroking.
    * sexual gesturing or staring.


### Question 2:

What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

### Answer 2:

In such a scenario, I would follow three levels of action:
* First, I would informally inform the person that their actions are out of line and they immediately need to stop. This informal conveyance of offense taken signals the harasser and at the same time gives him a chance to improve on his mistakes in some situations, it can also be a case of misunderstanding, in that case, also no strict actions would be taken against the falsely accused and the situation would not get escalated to higher levels.
* Second level of action would be followed if the harasser continues to cross the line even after the first warning. Now, the action would involve issuing a written email or letter to the harasser that if such a thing were to happen in the future again, then the matter would straight away be taken to higher authorities in the workplace environment.
* Third level of action would be informing the appropriate authorities or individuals such as the supervisor, human resources representative, school administrator, or law enforcement agency, depending on the situation and severity of the behavior.
